Here are ten accounts in an array with id 0, 1, . . . , 9, and initial 
balance $100. The system prompts the user to enter an id. If the id is 
entered incorrectly, ask the user to enter a correct id. Once an id
is accepted, the main menu is displayed as shown in the sample run. You can
enter a choice 1 for viewing the current balance, 2 for withdrawing money, 3 for
depositing money, and 4 for exiting the main menu. Once you exit, the system
will prompt for an id again. Thus, once the system starts, it will not stop.
